# Free-Front-end-Resources 
I'm broke and can't afford a graphic designer gf so I compiled this curated collection of websites where fellow bankrupt front-end devs can find a wide range of (mostly) free, high-quality icons, illustrations, and visual resources for their project. 


## Icons

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
